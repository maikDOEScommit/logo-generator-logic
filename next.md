Hello Claude. We are refining the core user experience of our logo generator. The goal is to make the typography selection process more powerful and intuitive.

We will change the workflow: Instead of the user selecting a single font family, they will now select a "Font Style Category". The system will then automatically generate multiple logo variations, one for each font within that chosen category. This requires changes to our data structure, UI, and preview logic.

Please implement the following changes precisely. The overall design and other steps of the generator should remain untouched.

Step 1: Refactor the Font Data Structure
Goal: Group our fonts into predefined style categories.

Action: Modify the file lib/data.ts. The current fonts array is flat. You need to replace it with a new structure: an object or map where each key is a category name and the value is an array of three FontData objects.

New Font Library:
Please use the following 12 curated fonts, grouped into 4 distinct categories.

Category 1: "Modern & Klar" (Modern & Clear)

Poppins

Montserrat

Lato

Category 2: "Elegant & Klassisch" (Elegant & Classic)

Playfair Display

Lora

Cormorant Garamond

Category 3: "Seri√∂s & Stark" (Serious & Strong)

Merriweather

Libre Baskerville

PT Serif

Category 4: "Technisch & Strukturiert" (Technical & Structured)

Roboto Mono

Source Code Pro

Inconsolata

The new data structure in lib/data.ts should look like this:

TypeScript

// Example of the new structure in lib/data.ts

export const fontCategories = {
'modern-klar': [
{ name: 'Poppins', family: 'sans-serif', /* ...other properties */ },
{ name: 'Montserrat', family: 'sans-serif', /* ...other properties */ },
{ name: 'Lato', family: 'sans-serif', /* ...other properties */ }
],
'elegant-klassisch': [
{ name: 'Playfair Display', family: 'serif', /* ...other properties */ },
// ... two more fonts
],
// ... two more categories
};
Remove the old, flat fonts array completely.

Step 2: Update the UI for Category Selection
Goal: The user should now select a category, not a single font.

Action: Modify the component components/editor/Step3_Design.tsx.

Remove the existing font selection logic. The entire part that maps over the suggestedFonts array and renders SelectionCards for each font family should be deleted.

Create a new "Typografie-Stil" section. This section should map over the keys of our new fontCategories object from lib/data.ts.

For each category, render a SelectionCard. The card should display the name of the category (e.g., "Modern & Klar").

You will need a new state in app/page.tsx to manage the selection, for example: const [selectedFontCategory, setSelectedFontCategory] = useState<string | null>(null);. The onClick of the SelectionCard should update this state.

Step 3: Adapt the Preview and Generation Logic
Goal: The preview panel must now display multiple logo variations based on the selected category.

Action: Modify the component components/preview/LogoPreview.tsx. This is the most critical change.

Change the component's logic: The component currently renders a single <LogoCanvas>. It should now render a list of logos.

Get the fonts: Inside the component, use the selectedFontCategory to get the corresponding array of three FontData objects from fontCategories.

Loop and render: Map over this array of three fonts. In each iteration of the loop:

Create a temporary LogoConfig object. This object should be a copy of the main config state, but with the font property set to the current font from the loop.

Render one <LogoCanvas> component for each of these temporary configs.

Display the results: Wrap the generated logos in a flex container so they appear neatly arranged (e.g., in a single column with some spacing). You can add a small title above each logo variation with the name of the font family.

The logic inside LogoPreview.tsx will be roughly:

JavaScript

// Pseudo-code for the new logic in LogoPreview.tsx

// 1. Get the array of fonts for the selected category
const fontsInSelectedCategory = fontCategories[selectedFontCategory];

// 2. If a category is selected, map over the fonts
if (fontsInSelectedCategory) {
return (
<div>
{fontsInSelectedCategory.map(font => {
// 3. Create a specific config for this font variation
const variationConfig = { ...config, font: font };

        return (
          <div key={font.name} className="mb-4">
            <h4 className="text-sm mb-2">{font.name}</h4>
            <LogoCanvas config={variationConfig} />
          </div>
        );
      })}
      {/* ... Download button logic might need adjustment ... */}
    </div>

);
}
By following these three steps, you will successfully refactor the application to the new, more powerful category-based workflow while leaving the rest of the application's design and structure intact.
